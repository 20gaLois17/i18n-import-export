# nuxt-i18n-import
This module provides functionality to export i18n translation snippets to a .csv file. Also, a given .csv file can be used to import snippets back into the project

## Please note that this is currently work in progress!

## Todo:
- cli interface to provide generalized functionality
- unit tests
- installable via npm
- add feature to not automatically overwrite newly created .csv export but instead generate a diff file which could be used as the basis for another import (which will merge with the current translation objects)
